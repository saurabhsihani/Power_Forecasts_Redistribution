# Power_Forecasts_Redistribution

# Reasons for the infeasibility of the solution given by the code may be as follows:
1. There are some wind farms for which the redistributed forecast exceeds its capacity, resulting in no feasible solution of the problem.
2. Inconsistencies in the initial data, like initial forecasts being unrealistic or errors in capacity values, can lead to infeasible solutions.
